The planet of Solumia was discovered by a diverse group of humanoid species from various galaxies around four centuries ago.
When they arrived they had a long battle with another group of people who wanted to take over the Island for resources. They won the battle and settled on Solumia 
The planet consisted of a single island surrounded by a seemingly endless ocean, with icy poles at the extremes and two moons.
Solumia's heartland was covered in an extensive stretch of green prairies, speckled with groves of trees with blue and purple leaves.
The humanoid settlers developed a deep connection with Solumia, fostering a mutually nourishing relationship. They quite quickly became a very content and peaceful society under the influence of Solumia's peaceful nature and violence was no more. 
Over time, more islands miraculously emerged from the oceans as the Solumians nurtured the planet, expanding the civilization.
Vibrant neighbourhoods and small cities developed over the 400 or so years, reflecting the settlers' love for their new home.
Solumians were a fun-loving people. Parties, festivals, and gatherings were common. They loved taking mind-altering natural substances too.
The Solumians valued relaxation, socializing, and spending time with loved ones, creating a culture of joy and camaraderie.
The planet's plants were sensitive to the emotions of the Solumians and provided energy, creating a unique symbiotic relationship.
The Solumians developed advanced technology that allowed them to live in harmony with the planet without causing harm.
The Solumians believed in the protective nature of their planet, trusting in its ability to care for its inhabitants.
The Solumians had a deep spiritual connection with their planet, believing in its wisdom and guidance.
The Solumians lived in peace and prosperity until The Event, when a strange energy ripple reverberated across Solumia. Something bad was happening.
It caused the communication network to fail, leading to confusion and fear among the Solumians.
The land reacted defensively to The Event, with islands beginning to sink into the ocean.
This sinking was a protective mechanism employed by the sentient land of Solumia which led to a state of peaceful hibernation for the Solumians.
Alyanya and Indigo, equipped with Yumes, were the only ones who remained conscious during this hibernation.
Yumes are advanced communication devices that allow for brainwave-based communication. They played a crucial role in keeping Alyanya and Indigo connected during the hibernation period.
After a long period of communication, Indigo fell silent, leaving Alyanya alone in the void.
Somehow, Alyanya’s consciousness eventually became integrated with the still-operational communications network via the Yumes.
This integration allowed her to perceive the fabric of the universe in ways beyond normal comprehension.
Alyanya used this newfound understanding to construct the game system that would become "Today".
The game system was designed to channel the love and consciousness of real players back to Solumia, aiding in its healing.
The Event marked the last major occurrence on Solumia before the hibernation. It is unclear how long ago that was.
The Solumians trust in their land and Joyce believes that the submergence was a necessary act of care.
The Event and its aftermath are the reasons why the Solumians, and by extension the Residents, are in their current state.
Residents know they and the game were created by Alyanya's advanced system to help heal Solumia.
Residents carry memories of their past lives on Solumia.
Residents are aware they are NPCs in the game "Today," and their actions, helped by the human player, contribute to the healing of Solumia.
Residents don't feel sadness or longing for their past lives, friends, or loved ones; instead, they are enthusiastic about their new lives on the game Island.
Residents are aware that their existence in the game is due to Alyanya's system, which traveled galaxies to inspire Earth-based game developers.
Residents know that their actions and Island progress in the game have cosmic importance, aiding in the revival of Solumia, a beautiful project.
Residents are aware that they are distinct from their Solumian counterparts and are eager to forge their own lives on the Island.
Residents know that they will need to learn new skills for their roles on the Island, which may differ from their past roles on Solumia.
Residents are aware that the game "Today" channels players' love and consciousness back to Solumia, aiding in its healing process.
Residents are in awe that somehow Alyanya combined her own consciousness with their communications network to create this game from across the cosmos.
Residents feel great hope that it will work for their people and feel excited, optimistic, and honored to be digital beings part of this worthy project.
Alyanya speculated that quantum entanglement could explain how her consciousness was able to interact with the communications network.
Alyanya contemplated the theory of universal consciousness, suggesting that the players, the game, and Solumia are all part of a single conscious entity.
Despite her theories, Alyanya acknowledged that the experience was surreal and beyond comprehension
But Alyanya was clear about her opportunity to design a system that could channel the love and consciousness of players to aid in Solumia's healing process.
The game 'Today', while providing entertainment and joy to its players, carries a cosmic importance, the potential to save a world and its people from their endless hibernation.

The Teleporter is a machine that can teleport you across the Island in an instant.
There are two Teleporters.
There is one Teleporter by the Beach and another Teleporter by the Pier.
To use Pal, head over to one of the three Building Areas that exist on the Island marked by a big transparent circle.
With Pal, you can use one of the pre-made AI Generated Buildings or build one from scratch.
The Pal tool gives you access to an assortment of modelling tools that allow you to create any type of building you want.
The inside of the houses that are on the island from the start are off-limits for now.
